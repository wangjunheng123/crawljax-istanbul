Crawljax 
========

Crawljax is a tool for automatically crawling and testing modern web applications. 
Crawljax can explore any (even single-page dynamic JavaScript-based) web application through an event-driven dynamic crawling engine.
It produces as output a state-flow graph of the dynamic DOM states and the event-based transitions between them.
Crawljax can easily be extended through its easy-to-use [plugin architecture](https://github.com/crawljax/crawljax/wiki/Writing-a-plugin).
